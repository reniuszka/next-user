STEPS:

1. npx create-react-app swap-person-app --template typescript
2. npm install axios:
   two methods to use: -axios.get(url) --axios.post(url)
3. npm install react-router-dom
4. There is a folder called noUsedComponents - wanted to make a register form from using an input component but got lost a bit with typescript and handling the state so followed with Form.tsx
